- Functional form issues for causal modeling
    - Assuming that I've controlled for everything!
    - Nothing to guarantee that confounding effects are linear
    - Let predictive modeling tools automate covariate selection, functional forms, interactions
- Bigger problem: regression coefficients aren't treatment effects
    - ATE, ATT
    - Aronow and Samii: coefficients are variance-weighted TEs.
    - The "effective sample" may not be your sample.
    - The "effective sample" may not resemble the population.
    - The only way that you have correspondence is if the treatment propensity is the SAME for all units.
    - There is no "general external validity basis" for preferring observational studies with regression vs. more careful causal inference methods.
    - Use ML to make predictions for Y, and the p(T).
- "What about the interpretation of the coefficients"
    - fuck that
    - the control coefficients are not interpretable as causal effects
    - They don't mean what you think they mean.
    - They are included ONLY to absorb confounding.
- Computing
    - covariate selection (LASSO?)
    - GAMS
    - cross-validation
